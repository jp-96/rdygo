# Summary

Big Thanks to VLAD-MARIUS ( https://www.thingiverse.com/VLAD-MARIUS/about ) for publishing his lego compatible basic bricks!
I repaired the broken meshes with Microsoft's Builder and filled the holes under the knobs. I also enforced the 1x? bricks. Now all the Bricks are way more FDM printer friendly!

The bricks are similar with the brick numbers shown.
The "L" means that the brick is large ( 1 large brick = 3 small bricks ) . 
The "S" means that the brick is small ( 3 small bricks = 1 large brick) .
--> i personally wasn't able to print the small bricks very well because of big bridging issues. if you succeed, please let us know how you did it !!
