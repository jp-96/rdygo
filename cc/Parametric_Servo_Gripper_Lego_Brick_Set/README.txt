# Summary

This is part of a set of customizable Lego compatible robotics components. This post is for various Lego compatible 9g servo mounts. This fits either the popular SG90 or the FS90R (continuous) servos. 

Files Included:
*6 differently oriented servo mounts.
*An openscad file for customizing the gripper/flag. (The flag is intended to be an accessory for a mini-sumo robot.)
*An openscad file for standard Lego bricks along with a printing calibration brick.
*(The compatible wheels shown are a separate Thingy.)

I recommend printing brick parts in ABS, but the grippers in semi-flexible TPU.  Printing Legos is tricky, see the print settings section for tips.

# Print Settings

Printer Brand: Prusa
Printer: Prusa Mk2
Rafts: No
Supports: No
Resolution: .2 Max
Infill: Any

Notes: 
3D Printing Legos is tricky but it can be done if your printer is tuned well. This model is designed to match Lego bricks perfectly, nothing is scaled. 

If you print it and the stud or base is too tight/loose then your printer needs adjusting, not the model. (Else you end up with weird settings that only work for one specific type of Lego... trust me I've printed a lot of Legos!)  

I recommend printing the calibration brick and getting your calipers out, then see attached image for dimensions. (Or just grab a regular 2x4 brick to measure)

 These are my recommendations for tuning the printer:  

* Change your extrusion multiplier, but never scale the model.
*Turn on 'detect thin walls'. 
*Turn on 'print external perimeters first' to ensure that path-overlap doesnt cause your critical outer surfaces to shift. 
*Printing with nozzle diameter .4mm or less, Layer height .2mm or less. 
*Always print Legos with studs facing the ceiling. 
*If all else fails and you want to rescue an imperfect brick, blast it with a heatgun for a few seconds then press it onto a real Lego and let cool. Careful, too much can easily ruin bricks too. 

*Ive printed Legos successfully in ABS, PETG, and TPU. The hard materials are unforgiving, but feel like real Legos if done right. The TPU bricks fall off easier but are also easier to print successfully.
